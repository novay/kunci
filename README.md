# Security adalah Kunci ðŸ”‘

`novay/kunci` is a **core Laravel package** that provides secure data encryption and decryption functionalities using OpenSSL. It offers a flexible architecture to manage encryption keys, including a default file-based driver, and serves as the foundation for integrating with various Cloud Key Management Services (KMS) via separate packages.

### Features
* **Secure Encryption & Decryption:** Utilizes the industry-standard **AES-256-CBC** algorithm via the PHP OpenSSL extension.
* **Flexible Key Management:** Supports a default file-based key driver and provides an extensible architecture for integrating with various Cloud KMS providers.
* **Automatic Key Generation:** Offers an Artisan command to generate cryptographically secure 64-character (256-bit) encryption keys for the file-based driver.
* **Seamless Laravel Integration:** Integrates smoothly with Laravel through its Service Provider and Facade, allowing easy switching between key management drivers.

### Installation

1.  **Add the Core Package to Your Project:**
    You can easily add `novay/kunci` to your Laravel project using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer require novay/kunci
    ```

2.  **Run Composer Update (Optional):**
    If you encounter any autoloading issues, you can try running:

    ```bash
    composer dump-autoload
    ```

3.  **Publish the Configuration File (Optional):**
    To publish the `kunci.php` configuration file to your main application's `config` directory (so you can customize key paths and other settings):

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=kunci-config
    ```

### Key Management

`novay/kunci` comes with a **file-based key driver** as its default. For enhanced security and cloud integration, consider using dedicated Cloud KMS driver packages (see [Cloud KMS Integration](#cloud-kms-integration) below).

#### Generating a New Key
For the file-based driver, you can create a new, secure 64-character (256-bit) encryption key using a dedicated Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan kunci:generate
````

By default, this command will create a `.key` file in `storage/app/private/`.

You can also specify a custom key file path:

```bash
php artisan kunci:generate --path=./path/to/your/secret.key
```

#### Key Path Configuration

For the file-based driver, this package will look for the key file at `storage/app/private/.key` by default. You can change this path via the `config/kunci.php` configuration file (after you've published it) or through the `KUNCI_KEY_FILE` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
# Your .env file
KUNCI_KEY_FILE=/absolute/path/to/your/custom/.key
```

#### Important: Key File Security

After generating the key file, it is **critically important** to protect it with appropriate file system permissions:

  * **Restrict Read Access:** Ensure that only the system user running your web server process (e.g., `www-data` or `nginx`) can read the file.
  * **Secure Location:** Store the key file outside any publicly accessible directory (`public_html` or `public/`). The `storage/app/` directory (or its subdirectories like `storage/app/private/`) is a recommended location.

Example commands to set permissions (adjust to your web server's user/group):

```bash 
chmod 600 storage/app/private/.key
chown www-data:www-data storage/app/private/.key # Replace www-data with the appropriate user/group
```

### Cloud KMS Integration

`novay/kunci` is designed to be extensible, allowing you to use various Cloud Key Management Services (KMS) as your encryption key source. This is achieved through separate, dedicated driver packages.

#### Supported KMS Drivers

Currently, the following Cloud KMS drivers are planned (or could be developed):

  * `novay/kunci-aws`: Integration with AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
  * `novay/kunci-azure`: Integration with Azure Key Vault.
  * `novay/kunci-gcp`: Integration with Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).

### Usage

The `Kunci` Facade provides a consistent interface regardless of the underlying key management driver configured.

#### Loading Key (Automatic Driver Selection)

When using a KMS driver, you don't explicitly "load" the key in the same way as the file-based driver. The `Kunci` Facade will automatically interact with the configured KMS service to perform cryptographic operations. You simply need to ensure your application has the correct permissions (IAM roles for AWS/GCP, Azure AD for Azure) to communicate with your KMS service.

You *do not* need to manually call `Kunci::loadKeyFromFile()` when using a KMS driver. The system handles the key's interaction with the KMS service internally.

#### Encrypting Data

Encrypting data remains simple, as the Facade abstracts the underlying key management:

```php
use Kunci; // Use the Facade

$dataToEncrypt = "This is highly sensitive information.";

try {
    $encryptedData = Kunci::encrypt($dataToEncrypt); // No key parameter needed here, it's managed by the driver
    echo "Original Data: " . $dataToEncrypt . "\n";
    echo "Encrypted Data: " . $encryptedData . "\n";
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Handle encryption errors (e.g., KMS connectivity issues, permissions)
    die("Encryption Error: " . $e->getMessage());
}
```

#### Decrypting Data

Decrypting data also uses the same consistent Facade interface:

```php
use Kunci;

// Assume $encryptedData is a valid string encrypted by Kunci
try {
    $decryptedData = Kunci::decrypt($encryptedData); 
    
    if ($decryptedData !== false) {
        echo "Decrypted Data: " . $decryptedData . "\n";
    } else {
        echo "Failed to decrypt data. Key might be incorrect or encrypted data is corrupt.\n";
    }
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Handle decryption errors
    die("Decryption Error: " . $e->getMessage());
}
```
